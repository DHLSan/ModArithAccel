# ModArithAccel

Efficient modulo arithmetic accelerator design for fixed prime numbers at RTL-level (VHDL).
The main objective of the project is to design an efficient modulo arithmetic accelerator for fixed prime at RTL in order to increase the performance of PQC schemes. This design is carried out within the scope of software and hardware design.
